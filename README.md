My name is Sahil Kohli, and thank you for visiting my GitHub page.

My thirst for knowledge and quest to understand the truth behind problems have lead me to pursue a career in Data Science & Informatics. I believe that data driven decisions are the way of the future, and I am excited to be able to play a pivotal role in the process of discovering insights. 

I am an individual who prides myself on my ability to absorb new information like a sponge and translate this knowledge into actionable insights that help drive and facilitate growth in any professional environment I join. Throughout my life, I want to push myself to achieve the highest level of performance that I can: I strive to get better each and every day. 

With my work-ethic and adaptability, I am confident that I can serve as a valuable member in any enviornment. As a glimpse of the different types of projects I like to work on, here is a collection of projects that I do in my spare time in order to sharpen my Data Science skills in data wrangling, feature selection, data visualization, model creation and machine learning. 

I hope you enjoy. Please reach out to me if you have any questions - sah.kohli11@gmail.com / sahilkoh@usc.edu. Thank you.
